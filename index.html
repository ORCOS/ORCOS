 Dear visitor,

welcome to the GitHub Pages of ORCOS (standing for Organic Reconfigurable Operating System) initially developed at the University of Paderborn. ORCOS is a highly customizable but easily configurable operating system suitable for any kinds of embedded hardware which is currently used in a couple of research projects and for teaching. Its key features are:
<p>
    A small binary footprint, making it suitable for even very small sensor nodes. This is achieved by the
    High configurability through a specially for this purpose developed configuration language based on XML. This enables you to configure only the functionality which is actually needed. Designs from a tiny and small kernel with just basic features for e.g. small sense and forward up to a feature rich kernel with virtual memory support for realtime systems with high performance demands are possible.
    Hybrid Kernel Architecture for special security needs.
    fully object oriented programming with C++
    Self-X Features are included inside the selfx branch. Transparent Communication and Migration is supported (experimental) inside the master branch. 

</p>

The main documentation of ORCOS is automatically generated through doxygen, so this wiki provides basic information on how to get started with ORCOS in general and provides links to the doxygen documentation.

ORCOS is available for
<p>
    PowerPC405
    Sparc Leon3
    ARMv4(t) and above
    QEMU (ORCOS runs emulated using QEMU for the PowerPC405)
    OMAP3530/DM35xx SOC (Support: available I2C, Serial and Timer Support, USB HC, MMC/SD).
